# Deep Learning Projects – Arbitrage & Stock Market Prediction

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating practical applications of machine learning in financial markets:

1. **Arbitrage.ipynb** – A quantitative arbitrage study using ML/statistical signals.  
2. **stock_market_predictor.ipynb** – A predictive model that forecasts stock price movements.

These notebooks focus on exploring real-world financial datasets, cleaning and transforming data, experimenting with ML models, and visualizing results.

## 📘 Notebooks Overview

### **1. Arbitrage.ipynb**
This notebook investigates how arbitrage opportunities can be identified using patterns in market data.

Typical components include:
- Data extraction and cleaning  
- Feature engineering for spreads, correlations, or mispricings  
- Statistical checks (stationarity, cointegration, etc.)  
- ML or rule-based detection of arbitrage signals  
- Backtesting or scenario-based demonstration  

The notebook aims to show how quantitative signals can highlight short-term mispricing between related financial instruments.

### **2. stock_market_predictor.ipynb**
This notebook demonstrates a simple stock-price forecasting workflow.

It commonly includes:
- Fetching historical stock data  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Train–test split  
- Building a prediction model (e.g., Linear Regression / LSTM / Random Forest)  
- Visualizing actual vs predicted values  

The goal is to illustrate how machine learning can model time-series behaviour for financial decision-making.
