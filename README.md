# Deep Learning for Statistical Arbitrage & Stock Market Prediction

This repository contains two complementary machine learning projects applied to financial markets:

1. **Arbitrage.ipynb** – A comprehensive and advanced statistical arbitrage pipeline with ML models, feature engineering, reinforcement learning, GAN-based synthetic data, and full model comparison.
2. **stock_market_predictor.ipynb** – A stock price prediction workflow demonstrating classical ML and time-series modeling.

These notebooks showcase real-world quantitative finance techniques using deep learning, reinforcement learning, synthetic data generation, and advanced technical indicators.
